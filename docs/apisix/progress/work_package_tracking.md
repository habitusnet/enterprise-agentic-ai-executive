### Critical Path Analysis

The critical path for implementation consists of:

1. **WP1: APISIX Infrastructure Setup** - This is the foundation for all other work packages
2. **WP3: Security & Multi-tenancy** - Required for financial and external API integration
3. **WP4: Financial & External API Integration** - The final dependent work package

Work Package 2 (LLM Service Layer & MCP Integration) can proceed in parallel with WP3 after WP1 is complete, as it has no dependency on security features for initial implementation.

## Conclusion

This work package tracking document provides a comprehensive framework for managing the implementation of the APISIX integration. By clearly defining the work package structure, dependencies, ownership, and tracking mechanisms, the implementation team can coordinate effectively to deliver the integration on schedule and with high quality.

The modular approach, with well-defined interfaces between work packages, allows for parallel development while ensuring that critical dependencies are respected. Regular tracking and reporting mechanisms provide visibility into progress and enable early identification of any issues that may affect the implementation timeline.
